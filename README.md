# MITRE-THREAT-HUNT.
This project demonstrates threat hunting in the finance sector using SocRadar for threat intelligence integration and the MITRE ATT&CK Framework for adversary tactics and techniques mapping. The work focuses on proactively improving detection of advanced threats targeting financial systems. By leveraging structured threat hunting methodologies, the project strengthens incident detection, response readiness, and overall cyber resilience in a high‑risk industry.

Inline with NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF):

 Detect (DE.AE – Anomalies and Events): Detected events are analysed to understand attack targets and malicious patterns.

 Detect (DE.CM – Security Continuous Monitoring)
 
 Respond (RS.AN – Analysis): Investigating alerts and correlating threat intelligence for incident response.
 

 
  ISO/IEC27001 Annex A:
 Annex A.8 (Technological Controls)
 
 Annex A.5 (Organizational Controls): Governance policies defining how threat hunting and intelligence integration are managed.
